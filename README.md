# TextAdventuregame

Welcome to the Text Adventure Game!
A simple text adventure game trying to be like the classic Zork. Who doesn't want to remake such a classic game? Here you move through a simple map trying to avoid hazards. In later implementations you just might be able to escape.

The player must move about the map collecting all of the gems from the enemies, but first it would be best to have a handy sword with you. After defeating the nasty enemies collect the gems they drop. One gem though you must get from the Angel. He wants his wings!
Once you have all of the gems you must go to the Hidden Room. There you must place the gems in the correct order (Blue, Green, Red, White) to recieve the key to make your escape. Go to the Goal Room and use (drop) the key to reach your freedom.
